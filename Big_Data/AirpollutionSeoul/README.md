# Seoul Air Quality Analysis with Hadoop MapReduce

This project utilizes Hadoop MapReduce to analyze air quality data from Seoul stored in a CSV file. (*CSV file is not included in this repo)

The implementation includes Mapper, Reducer, and Driver classes to perform various analyses on the air quality dataset.

## Implementation Details

### Mapper
- The Mapper class is responsible for processing the input data and emitting intermediate key-value pairs.

### Reducer
- The Reducer class processes the intermediate data generated by the Mapper, performing the required calculations for each region.

### Driver
- The Driver class orchestrates the execution of the MapReduce job, configuring parameters and managing the overall workflow.

## Project Tasks

1. **Average, Maximum, Minimum PM10 Measurements by Region (stationcode):**
   - Calculate the average, maximum, and minimum PM10 measurements for each region.

2. **Regions with the Highest 'Good' Air Quality Levels (based on PM10 and PM2.5):**
   - Identify the regions where air quality is classified as 'Good' most frequently based on PM10 and PM2.5 standards.

4. **Average Air Quality by Time Slot (SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM10, PM2.5):**
   - Calculate the average air quality for each time slot based on various pollutants including SO2, NO2, CO, O3, PM10, and PM2.5.
